We are offering three pricing tiers on an honesty basis: 

- **Early birds (apply by June 30), and those earning below €2000/month:**
  - 4 payments of €499, or save ~€200 by paying in a single payment of €1799

- **Standard:**
  - 4 payments of €599, or save ~€200 by paying in a single payment of €2199

- **Abundant (for folks with substantial disposable income or savings):**
  - 4 payments of €699, or save ~€200 by paying in a single payment of €2599


This is around the cost of a week-long personal development retreat -- yet *Life as Practice* offers a profoundly different kind of investment. Instead of a short, intensive burst, you receive a full year of continuous structure, guidance, and community support. This includes monthly group meetings, intimate pod check-ins, four one-on-one mentoring sessions, curated learning materials, ritual guidance, and the container to integrate these practices deeply into your daily life over twelve months. We believe this sustained approach offers exceptional value, fostering lasting transformation rather than a temporary peak experience. The tiered pricing aims to make the programme accessible while inviting those with greater means to contribute towards the sustainability of the offering.
