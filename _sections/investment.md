We are offering three pricing tiers on an honesty basis. Quarterly payment plans are available on request.

- **Early birds and those on low incomes (well below the median wage where you live/low income countries):** €1999
- **Standard:** €2499
- **Abundant (well above the median wage where you live):** €2999

This is around the cost of a week-long personal development retreat -- yet *Life as Practice* offers a profoundly different kind of investment. Instead of a short, intensive burst, you receive a full year of continuous structure, guidance, and community support. This includes monthly group meetings, intimate pod check-ins, four one-on-one mentoring sessions, curated learning materials, ritual guidance, and the container to integrate these practices deeply into your daily life over twelve months. We believe this sustained approach offers exceptional value, fostering lasting transformation rather than a temporary peak experience. The tiered pricing aims to make the programme accessible while inviting those with greater means to contribute towards the sustainability of the offering.
