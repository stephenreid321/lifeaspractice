<h2 style="text-transform: none">Stephen Reid</h2>

Hello, I'm [Stephen](https://stephenreid.net/)! I'm a technologist, facilitator and [coach](https://stephenreid.net/coaching) with training across fields including AI/ML, complexity science, physics, transformative coaching and insight meditation. Currently, I'm writing a book on [Technological Metamodernism](https://stephenreid.substack.com/p/technological-metamodernism-course), hosting courses and residencies as a founder of [Futurecraft](https://futurecraft.life/), and leading the development of [Dandelion](https://dandelion.events/) as a founder of not-for-profit worker co-op [Symbiota](https://symbiota.coop/).

Previously, I founded [The Psychedelic Society](https://psychedelicsociety.org.uk/), which established Europe's first legal [psilocybin retreat programme](https://www.alalaho.org/), and had the honor of serving as youngest ever board member of Greenpeace UK.

My academic background includes an MPhys in Physics from the University of Oxford, where I specialised in quantum field theory, an MRes in Complexity Science from the University of Bristol, and a Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from UC Berkeley.

I now call Stockholm, Sweden home, where I'm an active contributor to [Emerge Lakefront](https://emergelakefront.org/) and a keen [swimrunner](https://otilloswimrun.com/).

<h2 style="text-transform: none">Laura Gottlieb</h2>

Hi there, I'm Laura! I'm an integral facilitator and design researcher with a diverse background including philosophy, design, Bohmian dialogue, Authentic Relating, yoga, taekwondo and Zen Buddhism. I work for a major Swedish research institute and also facilitate residencies as a co-founder of [Futurecraft](https://futurecraft.life/). I hold qualifications as a facilitator with [Ten Directions](https://tendirections.com/), [Real LIFE](https://www.dianemushohamilton.com/), [The Philosophy Foundation](https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/) and [Core Quadrant](https://www.corequality.nl/?lang=en`), and I'm currently in training as an [Alethia Coach](https://integralunfoldment.com/).

My academic training includes a BA in Philosophy from the University of Southampton, an MA in Information Experience Design from the Royal College of Art in London, and a PhD on Relational Sensitivity in Participatory Design from MÃ¤lardalen University.

When I'm not facilitating or researching, you'll likely find me practicing kickboxing or creating tea ceremonies for friends.

We (Laura and Stephen) are partners in life as well as in this work, bringing our complementary skills and shared passion for integrative practice to this programme. As experienced facilitators, we've designed Life as Practice as a reflection of our own journey in weaving daily life with deep developmental work.
We believe that transformation happens not just in retreat settings but in how we show up every day, and we're excited to accompany you through a full solar cycle as you develop your own integrated approach. We look forward to meeting you and learning together throughout this year of practice!
