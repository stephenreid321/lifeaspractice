How to Apply
============

To begin your journey with *Life as Practice*, visit [lifeaspractice.com/apply](https://lifeaspractice.com/apply) to share your background, current practices, and what draws you to this yearlong journey. Applications for the 2025-2026 cohort will remain open until August 7, 2025, or until all spaces are filled.

We review applications on a rolling basis and aim to respond within two weeks of your submission. As part of our selection process, we may invite you to a brief video conversation to explore alignment and answer any questions you might have about the programme. Upon acceptance, you'll receive an invitation to secure your place with either a full payment or your first quarterly installment.

If you're interested in our early bird pricing, please submit your application by June 30, 2025, and complete your payment within two weeks of acceptance to qualify for the reduced rate.

Preparing for the Journey
-------------------------

Once your place is confirmed, you'll receive a welcome package with initial resources and reflections to start your preparation. We'll also grant you early access to our private Telegram community, allowing you to begin connecting with fellow participants before the official start date. You'll be invited to complete a pre-programme questionnaire that helps us tailor the experience to your specific needs and aspirations. For those eager to begin, we'll provide optional suggested readings and practices that can help prepare you for our September start, though no prior work is required.
