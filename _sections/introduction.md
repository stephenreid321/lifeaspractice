**What if everyday life could become your practice ground for profound growth and transformation? How would it feel to intentionally weave meditation, movement, learning, creativity, and self-reflection into the rhythm of your days? How might your experience shift if supported by dedicated mentors and a like-minded community for a full year?**

You are warmly invited to *Life as Practice*, a unique year-long group mentorship guided by Stockholm-based couple **Stephen Reid and Laura Gottlieb**. Running from September 2025 to August 2026, this immersive container is designed to help you integrate personal development into your daily existence, transforming routine into ritual and challenges into catalysts for growth. It's a journey into living more consciously and embodying your practice fully, within a supportive community structure.

At the heart of this journey lies the *Fivefold Focus,* a holistic framework designed to cultivate well-being and growth across key dimensions of your life. This structure ensures a balanced approach, encouraging you to engage deeply with: **Meditating**, developing focus and insight through quarterly themes inspired by the work of Rob Burbea; **Moving**, nurturing your physical vitality through consistent embodied practice; **Learning**, expanding your mind with curated readings and memory techniques like Anki; **Creating**, expressing your unique gifts through a personal project aided by cutting-edge tools; and **Reflecting**, deepening self-awareness through regular journaling. These five pillars form the core activities that will ground your practice throughout the year.

Holding and supporting this deep work is the *Fivefold Container*, the carefully crafted structure that provides rhythm, connection, and guidance throughout the year. This container weaves together various forms of engagement: **Full Moon Meetings** bring the entire group together for shared learning, guest insights, and optional tarot reflections; **New Moon Pods** foster intimacy and peer support in smaller, rotating groups; **Wheel of the Year Rituals** connect our practice to natural cycles and punctuate the year with *adhiṭṭhāna* weeks of strong determination; dedicated **one-on-one mentoring sessions** with both Laura and Stephen offer personalised guidance; and the potential for an **in-person co-created gathering** provides an opportunity for deeper embodied connection.

Together, the *Fivefold Focus* and the *Fivefold Container* create a powerful synergy, guiding your energy towards meaningful growth while providing the structure and community to sustain it. This year-long commitment is an invitation to step into a more integrated way of being, where practice isn't separate from everyday life, but the very way you engage with it. If you feel called to cultivate deeper awareness, resilience, creativity, and connection within a supportive and intentional framework, *Life as Practice* offers a unique and potent pathway for transformation over twelve cycles of the moon.
