Meditating
----------

Assisting you to **develop or maintain a strong meditation practice** is a foundation of the course. Each quarter will have a different meditative focus inspired by the insight meditation tradition, especially the work of Rob Burbea:

-   **Samādhi:** Cultivating deep concentration and calm abiding that creates a stable foundation for all other meditation practices.
-   **Mettā:** Developing loving-kindness toward yourself and others that transforms your relationship with the world.
-   **Emptiness:** Exploring the fluid, constructed nature of experience to loosen fixed views and open new dimensions of freedom.
-   **Soulmaking:** Engaging sensitivity and imagination  to discover deeper meaning and beauty in your lived experience.

We'll spend some time in each monthly meeting discussing the current meditative focus, along with suggesting relevant dharma talks to listen to.

Moving
------

We'll encourage you to **maintain one or more movement practices throughout the course**-- this could be running, swimming, lifting, dance, yoga or something completely different. You'll update your pod on your progress with the practice, and if you like, set goals or enter a competition during the year.

Learning
--------

We'll suggest **a different book to read (or re-read) each quarter**, resonant with the meditative focus, and spend some time at the monthly meeting discussing the latest chapters and any exercises within.

-   **Atomic Habits by James Clear:** A practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, consistent changes that compound over time.
-   **Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer:** An eloquent weaving of indigenous wisdom with scientific knowledge that cultivates gratitude, reciprocity, and loving relationship with the natural world.
-   **Seeing That Frees by Rob Burbea:** A profound meditation manual that guides you through increasingly subtle insights into emptiness and dependent arising.
-   **The Journey of Soul Initiation by Bill Plotkin:** A nature-based field guide for discovering your unique purpose and gifts in service to life.

In addition, we'll invite you to develop a good **Anki flashcard habit**, so that by the end of the year you could have learnt thousands of words in a new language, hundreds of tree or bird species, or accomplished some other feat of memory.

Creating
--------

We'll invite you to **pursue a creative project** throughout the year. Here are some examples to spark your imagination:

-   **Writing:** A collection of personal essays on your bioregion; a speculative fiction novel exploring post-capitalist societies; a poetry collection tracking seasonal changes
-   **Audio/Visual:** A podcast series interviewing elders in your community; a documentary film about local food systems; a music album inspired by your meditation experiences; a photography project capturing daily moments of beauty
-   **Anything else that brings you joy**: Designing and launching a neighbourhood tool library; choreographing a dance piece inspired by the tarot; crafting a series of ritual objects for seasonal celebrations

Throughout the year, you'll have opportunities to share your process and progress with the group. The focus is on the practice of creating rather than the final product, embracing both the challenges and breakthroughs that emerge.

We can provide **support in using cutting-edge AI tools** to maximise the amount of hours you spend in true creative flow, and minimise admin and rote tasks.

Reflecting
----------

We'll encourage you to **grow or maintain a reflective journaling practice** throughout the course. This could be handwritten and private, and/or you may choose to maintain an open digital log of your journey on Substack or similar.
