Full moon meetings
------------------

We'll meet as a whole group each month on the day of the full moon, 7pm-9pm Stockholm time. The first hour will be centered on the Five Focuses, with the second hour reserved for special guests and Q&A. You'll also have the option of drawing a tarot card to reflect on across the month.

New moon pods
-------------

You'll meet with your pod each month on the day of the new moon. Pods will be selected at random and change each quarter.

Wheel of the Year rituals
-------------------------

You'll be invited to mark each quarter/cross-quarter observance of the Wheel of the Year with a nature-based ritual. In addition, the week after each observance will be an *adhiṭṭhāna* week (a week of strong determination/strong will), where you're encouraged to make extra effort with each of the Five Focuses.

One-on-one mentoring sessions
-----------------------------

You'll be offered four one-on-one mentoring sessions throughout the year, two with Laura and two with Stephen.

An in-person co-created gathering
---------------------------------

The group will have the option of arranging an in-person co-created gathering in summer 2026. This could be a camp at a larger event like Nowhere or The Borderland, or it could be a standalone gathering. We'll support you with the preparation and planning, including showing you how to get the best out of Dandelion's Gatherings feature.
