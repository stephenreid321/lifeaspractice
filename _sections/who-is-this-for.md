Life as Practice is designed for individuals who:

-   Feel called to deepen their personal practice and integrate it more fully into daily life
-   Have some prior experience with meditation, self-reflection, or personal development work
-   Are ready to commit to a year-long journey of growth and transformation
-   Desire both structure and community to support their practice
-   Are willing to experiment with different modalities and approaches
-   Can dedicate consistent time to their practice throughout the year

While no specific credentials are required, this programme is most suitable for those who have already begun exploring personal development paths and are seeking a more integrated and sustained approach. Beginners are welcome if they feel drawn to this work, but some familiarity with meditation or contemplative practices will be helpful.

The programme is particularly well-suited for:

-   Professionals seeking balance and deeper meaning alongside their careers
-   Creators and knowledge workers looking to develop sustainable practice routines
-   Experienced meditators wanting to expand their practice into other life domains
-   Community builders interested in weaving personal and collective development
-   Anyone at a transition point seeking structure and support for their next chapter
