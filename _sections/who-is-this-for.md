Life as Practice is designed for individuals who:

-   Feel called to deepen their personal practice and integrate it more fully into daily life
-   Have some prior experience with meditation, self-reflection, or personal development work
-   Desire both structure and community to support their practice
-   Are willing to experiment with different modalities and approaches
-   Can dedicate consistent time to their practice throughout the year

You don't need to have prior experience in all five focus areas - part of the journey is developing these practices together. The container provides support for gradual growth in each dimension, meeting you where you are and helping you build consistency and depth over time. A diversity of experience within the group will be a valuable resource, creating opportunities for you to offer your wisdom in some areas while receiving guidance in others.

The programme is particularly well-suited for:

-   Professionals seeking balance and deeper meaning alongside their careers
-   Creatives looking to develop sustainable practice routines
-   Experienced meditators wanting to expand their practice into other life domains
-   Community builders interested in weaving personal and collective development
-   Anyone at a transition point seeking structure and support for their next chapter
